Bootstrap the MRS without --mrs-ensure-metadata-schema parameter.
There schema is missing so we expect an error
# Bootstrapping MySQL Router instance at 'DIRECTORY'

- Storing account in keyring
- Creating configuration .../mysqlrouter.conf

# MySQL Router configured for the Standalone MySQL Server at 'localhost'

After this, MySQL Router can be started with the generated configuration with:

$ mysqlrouter -c .../mysqlrouter.conf

This Router instance can be reached by connecting to:

## MySQL Classic protocol

- Read/Write Connections: localhost:6446
- Read/Only Connections:  localhost:6447
- Read/Write Split Connections: localhost:6450

## MySQL X protocol

- Read/Write Connections: localhost:6448
- Read/Only Connections:  localhost:6449

MySQL REST Service metadata was not found at the target MySQL server. Please deploy it before bootstrapping MRS. You can use '--mrs-ensure-metadata-schema' parameter to create the metadata schema.
DROP USER 'admin'@'%';
